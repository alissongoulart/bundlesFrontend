# Bundles frontend

### Description

A simple interface to display broadband combinations

### Requirements
- The [REST interface](https://github.com/alissongoulart/bundlesREST) must be running at the same time

### Run
Open the file `Ã¬ndex.html` in your preferred browser

### Important
It is necessary that the REST Interface runs in the address `localhost:8000`, because that is the host pointed in the ajax request.
